I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="https://huggingface.co/umbc-nlp" target="_blank">Language Understanding Lab</a> at the <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/" target="_blank">University of Maryland, Baltimore County</a>, advised by Prof. <a href="https://userpages.cs.umbc.edu/ferraro/" target="_blank">Francis Ferraro</a>.

My research focuses on **Trustworthy Foundation Models**, including **reasoning**, **privacy-preserving LLMs**, **unlearning**, and **robustness**. My work appears at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14275" target="_blank">**GenAI4Health@NeurIPS 2025**</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18536" target="_blank">**T2FMs@ICCV 2025**</a>. In reasoning, I develop methods that evaluate scientific claims with LLMs by coupling targeted retrieval with structured inference. This coupling makes the inference chain explicit and anchors conclusions in feasible evidence. A second thrust of my work develops privacy-aware and robust learning for distributed settings, focusing on federated language models and Differential Privacy for sensitive data.

Previously, I earned my MS in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.utrgv.edu/cecs/departments/csci/" target="_blank">University of Texas Rio Grande Valley</a>, where I worked on privacy-preserving federated learning for biometrics and differential privacy, contributing to projects that received NSF funding.
